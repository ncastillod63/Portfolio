      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a systems engineer and a specialist in Information Technology Management. I enjoy learning new things, and I like to analyze and teach what I learn. I love customer service because I like to help people and solve problems. I believe sharing knowledge is very important. Learning is part of my daily life, and I always try to improve my skills.</p>
      <p>I am also a technician in payroll and social benefits from SENA. I have experience in social security and I have worked as an analyst in insurance companies. Now, I am studying programming at Riwi because I want to become a junior software developer. I am excited about this new path, and I enjoy building solutions with technology.</p>
